Cloning a website homepage to practice my web development skills a bit. I struggled getting the help chat box to appear with the page, but overall I'm really happy with how the layout came together. Pretty much just eye balled the website and tried to copy it without looking into the inspector tool and I think I did a decent job and learned more about div placements, using flex at certain times and not at others and the magic of using margin.
